# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Telegram Bot Setup Foundation
> Created: 2025-09-28
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement the core Telegram bot infrastructure for ClientCheck using Grammy.js framework, enabling users to interact with client verification services through a Telegram interface. This foundation will provide authentication, basic commands, session management, and integration with existing database services while preparing for future AI analysis and admin features.

## User Stories

### Bot User Registration and Authentication
As an escort service worker, I want to start using the ClientCheck bot and authenticate myself, so that I can access client verification features based on my role and permissions.

The user sends /start to the bot, which triggers the authentication flow using the existing UserService. The bot validates the Telegram user against the database, creates or retrieves their user record, and sets up appropriate permissions. Users receive welcome messages tailored to their role (Regular User, Verified User, Manager, Admin) with access to relevant features.

### Phone Number Verification Access
As a verified user, I want to check a client's phone number through the bot, so that I can quickly verify their safety status before meeting.

The user sends /check command or provides a phone number, which triggers the ClientService to search the database for existing client information. The bot displays available information including reviews, ratings, and any safety warnings while respecting user permissions and rate limits.

### Profile and Settings Management
As a bot user, I want to manage my profile and settings through the bot interface, so that I can control my privacy, notification preferences, and account details.

Users access /profile and /settings commands to view and modify their account information using the existing UserService. The bot provides inline keyboard navigation for easy profile updates, preference changes, and privacy controls while maintaining data security.

## Spec Scope

1. **Grammy.js Bot Framework Setup** - Configure bot with TypeScript, webhook support, and session management using Redis
2. **Authentication Integration** - Connect to existing UserService for Telegram ID verification and role-based access control
3. **Core Command Structure** - Implement essential commands (/start, /help, /check, /profile, /settings) with proper middleware
4. **Service Layer Integration** - Connect bot to existing database services (Client, Review, User, RateLimit, PhotoStorage, BotConfig)
5. **Session and State Management** - Implement conversation state handling and user session persistence

## Out of Scope

- Admin bot implementation (separate roadmap item)
- AI analysis integration (future enhancement)
- Advanced inline query functionality
- Payment processing or subscription management
- Web interface or dashboard (bot-only interface)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional Telegram bot that can authenticate users, respond to basic commands, and integrate with existing database services
2. Complete Grammy.js setup with webhook configuration ready for production deployment
3. All existing services (UserService, ClientService, ReviewService, etc.) accessible through bot interface with proper error handling and rate limiting
